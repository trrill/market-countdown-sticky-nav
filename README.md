Oh, crazy... I just found this lil thing I made a few years ago. It was the first time I ever wrote React.js for real on my own... not just fumbling through a tutorial or fixing a lil icon or whatever in someone else's code.

The niche for this is... no one, except for the folks I made this for.

Rather than a single-page app, this is a React-based widget/mini-app that can be instantiated multiple times on a given page on any element. Give it some data attributes, and as the user scrolls past a target element,  lo appeareth a sticky bar with some customizable text, CTA, and a countdown to the next open/close of US stock markets.

The code was from like 2020, so I updated the whole thing with now-ish best-ish practices.

BYE.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run build:widget`
To compile the app into single JS and CSS files so that, for instance, a user can use them with a embed div like a widget.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
